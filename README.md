## Intro to Java
A. java program can  be characterized as an **object** represented in a **class**.
Currently our program has a *Main* object. Inside of this object we have a *Main* class.

## Output
In java to output an item to the counsel we use: System.out.print()' and System.out.print()'
System.out.print

## Comments
a comment is used as user annotation with the purpose of being human readable.
**Line Comments** follow double backslashes
**Block  Comments** are contained within /* Comments */

In Java use the term indentifiers to descrbe a variable,parameter,constant,user-defined mothod or user-defined class.

- Cannot begin with digit
-can only contain letters digits and underscores
-Case-sensitive 'age!= Age'

note
- class name starts with a capital letter
- reserved words are entirely lowercase and may not be used as identifiers( reserved words will show up in blue.)

## Types 
Primitive or built-up types in Java are
- 'int ' An integer
-'boolean'  True or False (boolean shirtColor = true)
-'double' floating point number(2.73) (compared to float in python)

-'char' single character
'Note:' Integers have a fixed amount of memory, so there is a limit to how many digits you can store(2^21 -1)

## Variables
Variables are a type of identifier that stores a value of specific type

we can create variables using **declaration**
-Int age;
-double x,y;
-boolean found;
-char letters;
We can also initialize a variable in its **declaration**
